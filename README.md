# Restaurant Otaku

## Project Description

This  project is a responsive and user-friendly web application that allows users to search for nearby restaurants in either an Australian suburb or city. It also includes a save function in which users can save a list of their favourite restaurants and add notes and images for personal reference. 

## Project Goals

This project aims to create a seamless, easily navigable and handy web application for either one-time or recurring users. The main objective of the project is to incorporate practical functions into the application so that frequent restaurant-goers have a convenient and personalised restaurant-searching and saving tool. User experience will be further enhanced by the employment of intuitive design.
